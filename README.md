# PDF and Image Converter

This repository provides a set of Python scripts for performing various operations on PDFs and images. It includes functionality for converting PDFs to images, merging and splitting PDFs, converting images back to PDFs, and compressing PDF files.

## Features

- Convert PDF files to JPEG images.
- Convert JPEG images to a single PDF file.
- Merge multiple PDF files into one.
- Split a PDF into single-page PDFs.
- Compress PDF files to reduce size.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you will need the following Python libraries:

```
pip install PyPDF2 pdf2image tqdm fpdf pillow
```

Additionally, `pdf2image` requires the installation of the **Poppler** library. Instructions for installing Poppler can be found at the following link:

- [Poppler Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image#installing-poppler)

## Usage

### 1. Convert PDF to JPEG

Use the script to convert PDF pages into JPEG images.

```
python convert.py pdf_to_jpg <pdf_file_path> <output_dir> --first-page <first_page> --last-page <last_page> --dpi <dpi>
```

- `pdf_file_path`: The path to the PDF file you want to convert.
- `output_dir`: The directory where the output JPEG files will be saved.
- `first_page`: (Optional) The first page to convert.
- `last_page`: (Optional) The last page to convert.
- `dpi`: (Optional) Resolution of the output JPEG images (default: 300 DPI).

Example:

```
python convert.py pdf_to_jpg sample.pdf ./output --first-page 1 --last-page 5 --dpi 300
```

### 2. Convert JPEG to PDF

Convert a list of JPEG images to a single PDF file.

```
python convert.py jpg_to_pdf <image_file_paths> <output_dir>
```

- `image_file_paths`: The list of image file paths to be converted.
- `output_dir`: The directory where the output PDF will be saved.

Example:

```
python convert.py jpg_to_pdf image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg ./output
```

### 3. Merge Multiple PDFs

Merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF.

```
python convert.py merge_pdfs <pdf_file_paths> <output_dir>
```

- `pdf_file_paths`: The list of PDF file paths to be merged.
- `output_dir`: The directory where the merged PDF will be saved.

Example:

```
python convert.py merge_pdfs file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf ./output
```

### 4. Split a PDF into Single-Page PDFs

Split a PDF into multiple single-page PDF files.

```
python convert.py split_pdfs <pdf_file_path> <output_dir>
```

- `pdf_file_path`: The path to the PDF file to be split.
- `output_dir`: The directory where the split PDF files will be saved.

Example:

```
python convert.py split_pdfs sample.pdf ./output
```

### 5. Compress a PDF

Compress a PDF file by reducing the size of its content streams.

```
python convert.py compress_pdf <pdf_file_path> <output_dir>
```

- `pdf_file_path`: The path to the PDF file to be compressed.
- `output_dir`: The directory where the compressed PDF will be saved.

Example:

```
python convert.py compress_pdf large_file.pdf ./output
```

## File Descriptions

### `args_parser.py`

This file defines the command-line argument parser using `argparse`. It supports various subcommands for performing PDF and image conversions.

#### Supported Commands:

- `jpg_to_pdf`: Convert one or more JPEG images into a PDF.
- `pdf_to_jpg`: Convert PDF pages into JPEG images.
- `merge_pdfs`: Merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF.
- `split_pdfs`: Split a PDF into multiple single-page PDF files.
- `compress_pdf`: Compress a PDF file.

### `convert.py`

This script contains the core functions for performing the conversion tasks. It handles PDF to image conversion, image to PDF conversion, merging PDFs, splitting PDFs, and compressing PDFs.

### `main.py`

This is the entry point of the program. It invokes the appropriate functions based on the command-line arguments provided by the user.
